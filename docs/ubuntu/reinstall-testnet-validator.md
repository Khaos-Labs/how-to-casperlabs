# Reuse Delta Validator node as Test Net Validator node on Ubuntu 20.04

> ## **IMPORTANT**
> By choosing to participate in the Casper Test Net, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and will abide by
> the [Test Net Code of Conduct and Incentive Requirements](../testnet.md). Failure to do so may reduce or fully 
> disqualify any Test Net incentive participation.
> 
> Before you set up your node, make sure it conforms to the minimum [Recommended Hardware Specifications](https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/node-operator/hardware.html)


> ### Note  
> Do not execute all the commands below as root. `sudo` is included where it is required.
> 
> Expect that setting up a node and bonding it to the network will take about 30 minutes

## Set version and network you're going to set up

Set a variable defining the version of the node package you're setting up. For `1.0.0`, use `1_0_0`

```
CASPER_VERSION=1_0_0
```

Set a variable defining the network name you're trying to set up. For example, for Main Net, use `casper`, while for Test Net use `casper-test`

```
CASPER_NETWORK=casper-test
```

## Reinstall software

### Stop the node if it is running and remove old packages and configuration

```
sudo systemctl stop casper-node-launcher.service
sudo apt remove -y casper-client
sudo apt remove -y casper-node-launcher
sudo rm /etc/casper/casper-node-launcher-state.toml
sudo rm -rf /etc/casper/1_0_*
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/casper/*
```

### Download and install new node software

#### Add Casper repository

Execute the following in order to add the Casper repository to `apt` in Ubuntu. 
```shell
echo "deb https://repo.casperlabs.io/releases" bionic main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/casper.list
curl -O https://repo.casperlabs.io/casper-repo-pubkey.asc
sudo apt-key add casper-repo-pubkey.asc
sudo apt update
```

#### Install the Casper node software

```
sudo apt install casper-node-launcher -y
sudo apt install casper-client -y
```

## Configure and Run the Node

### Set up configuration

```
sudo -u casper /etc/casper/pull_casper_node_version.sh $CASPER_NETWORK.conf $CASPER_VERSION
sudo -u casper /etc/casper/config_from_example.sh $CASPER_VERSION
```

### Get known validator IP

Let's get a known validator IP first. We'll use it multiple times later in the process.

```
KNOWN_ADDRESSES=$(sudo -u casper cat /etc/casper/$CASPER_VERSION/config.toml | grep known_addresses)
KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IPS=$(grep -oE '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' <<< "$KNOWN_ADDRESSES")
IFS=' ' read -r KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP _REST <<< "$KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IPS"

echo $KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP
```

After running the commands above the ```$KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP``` variable will contain IP address of a known validator.

### Set trusted hash

Get the trusted hash from the network:

```
# Get trusted_hash into config.toml
TRUSTED_HASH=$(curl -s $KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP:8888/status | jq -r .last_added_block_info.hash | tr -d '\n')
if [ "$TRUSTED_HASH" != "null" ]; then sudo -u casper sed -i "/trusted_hash =/c\trusted_hash = '$TRUSTED_HASH'" /etc/casper/$CASPER_VERSION/config.toml; fi
```

### Start the node

```
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/casper-node
sudo systemctl start casper-node-launcher; sleep 2
systemctl status casper-node-launcher
```

### Monitor the node status

#### Check the node log

```
sudo tail -fn100 /var/log/casper/casper-node.log /var/log/casper/casper-node.stderr.log
```

#### Check if a known validator sees your node among peers

```
curl -s http://$KNOWN_VALIDATOR_IP:8888/status | jq .peers
```

You should see your IP address on the list

#### Check the node status

```
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/status
```

#### Wait for node to catch up
Before you do anything, such as trying to bond as a validator or perform any RPC calls, make sure your node has fully 
caught up with the network. You can recognize this by log entries that tell you that joining has finished, and that the
RPC and REST servers have started:

```
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.577","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"finished joining"},"target":"casper_node::cli"}
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.578","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"started JSON-RPC server","address":"0.0.0.0:7777"},"target":"casper_node::components::rpc_server::http_server"}
{"timestamp":"Feb 09 02:28:35.578","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"started REST server","address":"0.0.0.0:8888"},"target":"casper_node::components::rest_server::http_server"}
```

## Re-build smart contracts that are required to bond to the network 

### Install additional prerequisites
The following pre-requisite was not required during the Delta network but is highly advised during Test Net and Main Net

```
cd ~
BRANCH="1.0.20" \
    && git clone --branch ${BRANCH} https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt.git "wabt-${BRANCH}" \
    && cd "wabt-${BRANCH}" \
    && git submodule update --init \
    && cd - \
    && cmake -S "wabt-${BRANCH}" -B "wabt-${BRANCH}/build" \
    && cmake --build "wabt-${BRANCH}/build" --parallel 8 \
    && sudo cmake --install "wabt-${BRANCH}/build" --prefix /usr --strip -v \
    && rm -rf "wabt-${BRANCH}"
```

### Build smart contracts

#### Get casper-node
If you don't have it yet, clone casper-node:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node.git
```

#### Go to the directory with casper-node sources

```
cd ~/casper-node
```

#### Pull the latest changes

```
git fetch
```

#### Checkout the release branch

> **Note**  
> Verify that the version of your contracts matches the version of the casper-node software you have
> installed.

```
git checkout release-1.0.0
```

#### Remove previous builds

```
make clean
```

#### Build the contracts

```
make setup-rs && make build-client-contracts -j
```

## Fund your account

To fund an account visit the [Faucet](https://clarity-testnet.make.services/#/faucet) page. Select the account you want to fund and hit "Request Tokens". Wait until the request transaction succeeds.

## Bond to the network

Once you ensure that your node is running correctly and is visible by other proceed to bonding.

### Check your balance

Check your balance to ensure you have funds to bond:

To get the balance we need to perform the following three query commands:

1. Get the state root hash (has to be performed for each balance check because the hash changes with time): 

    ```
    casper-client get-state-root-hash --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 | jq -r
    ```
2. Get the main purse associated with your account:

    ```
    sudo -u casper casper-client query-state --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --key <PUBLIC_KEY_HEX> --state-root-hash <STATE_ROOT_HASH> | jq -r
    ```

3. Get the main purse balance:

    ```
    casper-client get-balance --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --purse-uref <PURSE_UREF> --state-root-hash <STATE_ROOT_HASH> | jq -r
    ```

If you followed the installation steps from this document you can run the following script to check the balance:

```
PUBLIC_KEY_HEX=$(sudo -u casper cat /etc/casper/validator_keys/public_key_hex)
STATE_ROOT_HASH=$(casper-client get-state-root-hash --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 | jq -r '.result | .state_root_hash')
PURSE_UREF=$(sudo -u casper casper-client query-state --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --key "$PUBLIC_KEY_HEX" --state-root-hash "$STATE_ROOT_HASH" | jq -r '.result | .stored_value | .Account | .main_purse')
casper-client get-balance --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 --purse-uref "$PURSE_UREF" --state-root-hash "$STATE_ROOT_HASH" | jq -r '.result | .balance_value'
```

### Make bonding request

To bond to the network as a validator you need to submit your bid using ```casper-client```:

```
sudo -u casper casper-client put-deploy \
        --chain-name "<CHAIN_NAME>" \
        --node-address "http://127.0.0.1:7777/" \
        --secret-key "/etc/casper/validator_keys/secret_key.pem" \
        --session-path "$HOME/casper-node/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/add_bid.wasm" \
        --payment-amount 1000000000 \
        --gas-price=1 \
        --session-arg=public_key:"public_key='<PUBLIC_KEY_HEX>'" \
        --session-arg=amount:"u512='900000000000'" \
        --session-arg=delegation_rate:"u8='10'"
```

Where:
- ```amount``` - This is the amount that is being bid. If the bid wins, this will be the validator’s initial bond amount. Recommended bid in amount is 90% of your faucet balance.  This is ```900 CSPR```  or ```900000000000 motes``` as an argument to the ```add_bid``` contract deploy. 
- ```delegation_rate``` - The percentage of rewards that the validator retains from delegators that delegate their tokens to the node.

Replace:
- ```<CHAIN_NAME>``` with the chain name you are joining
- ```<PUBLIC_KEY_HEX>``` with the hex representation of you public key 

Remember the ```deploy_hash``` returned in the response to query its status later.

If you followed the installation steps from this document you can run the following script to bond. It substitutes the public key hex value for you and sends recommended argument values:

```
PUBLIC_KEY_HEX=$(sudo -u casper cat /etc/casper/validator_keys/public_key_hex)
CHAIN_NAME=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/status | jq -r '.chainspec_name')

sudo -u casper casper-client put-deploy \
    --chain-name "$CHAIN_NAME" \
    --node-address "http://127.0.0.1:7777/" \
    --secret-key "/etc/casper/validator_keys/secret_key.pem" \
    --session-path "$HOME/casper-node/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/add_bid.wasm" \
    --payment-amount 1000000000 \
    --gas-price=1 \
    --session-arg=public_key:"public_key='$PUBLIC_KEY_HEX'" \
    --session-arg=amount:"u512='900000000000'" \
    --session-arg=delegation_rate:"u8='10'"
```

### Check that you bonding request worked

Sending a transaction to the network does not mean that the transaction processed successfully. It’s important to check to see that the contract executed properly:

```
casper-client get-deploy --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777 <DEPLOY_HASH> | jq .result.execution_results
```

Replace ```<DEPLOY_HASH>``` with the deploy hash of the transaction you want to check.

### Query the auction info and look for your bid

To determine if the bid was accepted, execute the following command:

```
casper-client get-auction-info --node-address http://127.0.0.1:7777
```

The bid should appear among the returned ```bids```. If the public key associated with a bid appears in the ```validator_weights``` structure for an era, then the account is bonded in that era.
